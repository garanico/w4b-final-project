    <div id="about-2">
        <p>
         The Marauder's Map was a magical document that revealed all of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Not only did it show every classroom, every hallway, and every corner of the castle, but it also showed every inch of the grounds, as well as all the secret passages that were hidden within its walls and the location of every person on the grounds, portrayed by a dot.  It was also capable of accurately identifying each person, and was not fooled by Animagi, Polyjuice Potions, or invisibility cloaks.  Even the Hogwarts ghosts were not exempt.
         <br>
         <br>
         One of the map's possible flaws was that it did not differentiate people who had matching names (the shared names were not given a Junior or Senior at the end). Also, it did not seem to show unplottable rooms, as it was Dobby and not the map that revealed the existence and location of the Room of Requirement.
         <br>
        <br>
        The Chamber of Secrets never appeared on the map either because the creators never knew of it or it was unplottable as well, since when Ron and Hermione were in it collecting basilisk fangs, they did not appear on the map similar to the Room of Requirement.

        <h2>Creation</h2>

        <p>
        The Marauder's Map was created by Remus Lupin (Mooney), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), Sirius Black (Padfoot), and James Potter (Prongs) while they were attending Hogwarts.  The titles on the map refer to the nicknames of these men in their Animagus form, and, in Lupin's case, his werewolf form.  The four created the map via the usage of the Homonculous Charm, a powerful and advanced charm that enhanced the map to track the movements of everyone in the castle, as well as a charm to insult Severus Snape.
        <br>
        <br>
        The ability of Sirius, Peter, and James to become Animagi enabel them to explore the castle grounds by night undetected.  The interior of the castle was mapped over time with the help of James' Invisibility Cloak.
        <br>
        <br>
        This artefact proved quite useful to the foursome (commonly termed "the Marauders") through the years, until it was confiscated by Argus Filch. Although the precise circumstances surrounding the makers' loss of their map is mostly unknown, it is easy to conclude that they eventually over-reached themselves and were cornered by Filch, probably on a tip-off from Snape, whose obsession it had become to expose his arch-rival, James Potter, in wrongdoing.  The masterpiece of a map was confiscated in Sirius, James, Remus and Peter's final year and none of them were able to steal it back from a well-prepared and suspicious Filch.

    <div id="usage">
    <h2>Map Usage</h2>
        <p>
        The map is normally disguised as a blank piece of parchment.  To view the map, one must tap it with one's wand and recite, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."  The content of hte map will then reveal itself.
        <br>
        <br>
        To hide the contents of the map so the parchment appears blank again, one must again tap it and recite, <a href="index.html">"Mischief Managed."</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        An added bonus is that if the bearer of the map approaches the entrance to a secret passage protected by a password, the password will appear on the map (usually as a speech bubble that appears close to the dot representing the Map's holder.)
